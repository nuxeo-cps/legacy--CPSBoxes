This document presents an example that uses a logo box.


Adding a New Image
==================

1. Go into a workspace, an entity, or a community.

2. Click on "Manage boxes".

   This action is the box of actions for the document.  Note that
   it is *not* the "Manage root boxes" action.

3. Click on "Add a box".  Select "Image box".

   - Title: for example, "Logo 1"

   - Slot: "Center top"

   - Box skin: "min/max/close box"

   - visible in subfolder

   - Type: "A sample image box"


Override an Older Image
=======================

1. Enter the ZMI and within your CPS site, click on the
   ``workspaces`` folder, for example ``/cps/workspaces/area2``

2. In the container of the box, you should find::

       .cps_boxes

3. Click on the "Overrides" tab.

4. Add a new override: 

   Here it will be necessary to walk in order to find the box in
   ``.cps_boxes_root`` that you wish to override.  For example, if
   the box containing the logo of the site is called
   ``site_logo``, it will be necessary to use the following value::

       .cps_boxes_root/site_logo

5. Make the same number of Slot that is presented for the logo
   box, in this example "site_logo".  By default, it is usually
   10, but it is necessary to use the value used in your CPS site.

6. Click on "Save changes".
