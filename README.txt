CPSBoxes
----------

CPSBoxes contains the old CPS Boxe Types used until 3.3.2 revision of
CPS.  The goal of this product is to provide a backward compatibility
for old CPS3 instances and ease upgrade.

DO NOT USE BOXES ANYMORE ! SEE CPSPortlets 
(http://cvs.nuxeo.org/CPS3/CPSPortlets)

We will keep backward compatibility by including this package until CPS-3.4.x.

Check the warning within the log file and start to migrate your old
code now if you need to.

If you need help with please send mails to cps-devel@lists.nuxeo.com
